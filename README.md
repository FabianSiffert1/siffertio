My personal portfolio, written over the course of my apprenticeship
as software developer. A work-in-progress with many flaws and made with 
learning in mind.

## Setup
1. Make sure that [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is installed on your system.
2. Clone the project to your system using ```git clone```
3. Navigate to the directory you just cloned in a terminal of your choice and run
```npm install```

## Run
1. After the setup run ``` npm run start ``` to start the website locally on port 3000
